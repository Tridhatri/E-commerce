    <h2>About Friendly Neighbourhood Market</h2>
    <p>Hey there, web-slingers and fellow citizens! Welcome to the Friendly Neighbourhood Market, your one-stop-shop for all things friendly, fresh, and fantastic! I'm your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man, Peter Parker, and this is my brainchild.</p>
    <p>Why a grocery store, you ask? Well, after years of web-swinging and saving the day, I thought, "Why not save the day in a whole new way?" And what's more essential than ensuring our community gets the best groceries in town?</p>
    <p>Our team here is as diverse and dynamic as the rogues' gallery I face. We've got brains, brawn, and the heart to match. You'll find the spirit of Spider-Man woven into every aspect of our market. And speaking of our team, let me introduce you to my amazing friends who make all of this possible:</p>
